    **Schizosavvy** is an interactive chatbot designed to help individuals monitor their cognitive and emotional states through a series of questions.

    **Features:**
    - Cognitive and emotional state monitoring.
    - Schizophrenia stage prediction (Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3).
    - Interactive therapeutic conversation.
    - Additional support for user questions.

    Please remember that this chatbot is not a replacement for professional mental health advice.
